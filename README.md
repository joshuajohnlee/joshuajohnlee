# Hi!

My name is **Josh** (@joshuajohnlee) and I'm a thirty-something who's gone back to school. I'm currently studying for a Bachelor of Science in Computing and IT (Communications and Networking).

I'm especially interested in networking, network automation and cyber security. However, I enjoy most aspects of IT. I try to do some coding now and then for practice. I'm not well versed in a particular language, but I work mostly with Python when I'm coding for my own fun or study.

Ideally, I plan to sit my CCNA certification and then go on to become a Network Engineer, or perhaps branch into cyber security if that's the way life takes me.

For the moment, I'm just trying to learn as much as I can about as many technologies as I can to give me a good basis for a career.
